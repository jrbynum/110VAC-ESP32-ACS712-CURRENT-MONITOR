# 110VAC-ESP32-ACS712-CURRENT-MONITOR

A device that monitors a 110v outlet for current to detect if a device is using it. It then starts a timer to shutdown the device after 30 Minutes (configurable). Uses an D1 ESP8266 WeMos Mini and a ACS712 current sense chip, along with a .96 OLED for displaying current and status. I know the title says ESP32, my bad, I'm so use to using the 32's but I had a bunch of these laying around and this project seemed perfect for it. This project was inspired by my Daughter who continually worried about wether or not she had turned off her curling iron. I designed a circuit and PCB and 3D printed a case that can be pluged into the wall outlet and then the curling iron plug into it. If the curling iron, or any device that draws over .4 mA AC it starts a timer that will shut off the power after 30 min. I will be adding several features in the near future, wifi and web page inegration for interacting and checking the status.  

I added all the files I have - BOM, Gerbers for making boards, EasyEDA zipped project, the Arduino Code (I'm going to convert this to Visual Studio and PIO soon. The code is pretty well commented and easy to follow.
